# Pomodoro-Timer
A Pomodoro timer made with React as part of a project for Thinkful.

Distractions and time management are a problem that everybody needs to deal with - some more than others - and failing to manage it can have a severe effect on productivity. As one of the most popular time management techniques, a Pomodoro timer provides a strong framework for managing work and play, to get things done without burning out.

# How does a Pomodoro Timer work?

Any timer can be used as a Pomodoro timer. The system starts by giving the user a set amount of time to work, with the timer counting down during it. When the timer goes off, the user sets the timer for a Break, during which the user does not work at all. Then when that timer goes off, the work timer starts again, followed by a break, and repeats until the user decides the session is over. A typical system uses 25 minutes to work, and 5 minutes of break time.

# Why make a web app?

The pomodoro timer web app provides the convenience of an automated timer system to control working time and break time, without interruption and without requiring the user to manually set each timer.

# Features:
- Adjustable timers for work and break times
- Progress bar visualization accompanied by a countdown
- Audio alerts for each session
- Fully automated operation; set your parameters and get to work!
